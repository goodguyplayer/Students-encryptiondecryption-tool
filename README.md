# Students encryptiondecryption tool
 A small tool that I'm going to make to learn both encryptions/decryption and java.

# Currently have.:
- Caesar/shift cipher (Bit broken)
- GGP's fun encryption method (Something I made for fun) 


# ToDo.:
- Update caesar/shift cipher
- Add Vigen√®re
- Add Morse (Allow user to change characters)
- Affine
- Ascii to dec, hex, oct, bin
- Unicode, maybe?
- Enigma machine
- Base32 & Base64
- Url encoding for API, maybe?
- Modern cryptos (Research later)
- A CMD and GUI methods to "use" this
