# Students encryptiondecryption tool
 A small tool that I'm going to make to learn both encryptions/decryption and java.

Initially, there's going to be a conversion of an old encryption method I made with python, but the idea is to evolve it into having almost all encryption/decryption methods. And a small window to make things easier to see.
